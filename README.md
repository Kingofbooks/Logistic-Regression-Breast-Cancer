# Logistic-Regression-Breast-Cancer

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

-> Build a binary classifier using logistic regression to predict class labels (e.g., benign vs malignant tumors).

ðŸ›  Tools Used:

 1. Scikit-learn â€“ for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing

 2. Pandas â€“ for data loading and manipulation

 3. Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ for data visualization and plotting

ðŸ“‹ Steps Followed:

1. Choose a Dataset

-> Used a binary classification dataset such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing

-> Split into train/test sets using train_test_split.

-> Standardize features using StandardScaler to improve model convergence.

4. Model Training

-> Fit a logistic regression model using LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn.

5. Model Evaluation

 a. Used evaluation metrics:

  -> Confusion Matrix

  -> Precision & Recall

  -> F1-Score

  -> ROC-AUC Curve

  -> Threshold Tuning

  -> Explored changing the classification threshold instead of using the default 0.5.

  -> Explained the sigmoid function, which maps predictions to a probability between 0 and 1.
